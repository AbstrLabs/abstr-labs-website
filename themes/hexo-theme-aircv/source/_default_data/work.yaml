description: "Abstr Labs is a place full of ambitious people: we have a lot of freedom but also a very strong result-first mindset — what matters is getting things done.

 

We value purposefulness, creativity, directness, minimalism, initiative and less is more.

​

We are math people, we trust proof and make proof to work."
